                            A sweeping, tenderhearted love story, Beyond That, the Sea by Laura Spence-Ash tells the story of two families living through World War II on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and the shy, irresistible young woman who will call them both her own.

As German bombs fall over London in 1940, working-class parents Millie and Reginald Thompson make an impossible choice: they decide to send their eleven-year-old daughter, Beatrix, to America. There, she’ll live with another family for the duration of the war, where they hope she’ll stay safe.

Scared and angry, feeling lonely and displaced, Bea arrives in Boston to meet the Gregorys. Mr. and Mrs. G, and their sons William and Gerald, fold Bea seamlessly into their world. She becomes part of this lively family, learning their ways and their stories, adjusting to their affluent lifestyle. Bea grows close to both boys, one older and one younger, and fills in the gap between them. Before long, before she even realizes it, life with the Gregorys feels more natural to her than the quiet, spare life with her own parents back in England.

As Bea comes into herself and relaxes into her new life—summers on the coast in Maine, new friends clamoring to hear about life across the sea—the girl she had been begins to fade away, until, abruptly, she is called home to London when the war ends.

Desperate as she is not to leave this life behind, Bea dutifully retraces her trip across the Atlantic back to her new, old world. As she returns to post-war London, the memory of her American family stays with her, never fully letting her go, and always pulling on her heart as she tries to move on and pursue love and a life of her own.

As we follow Bea over time, navigating between her two worlds, Beyond That, the Sea emerges as a beautifully written, absorbing novel, full of grace and heartache, forgiveness and understanding, loss and love.

                                  Beyond That, the Sea by Laura Spence-Ash

In 1940 London, Millie and Reginald Thompson make the extremely difficult decision to send their eleven year old daughter to live with a well off family in America. It is really Reg who makes the decision but he allows their daughter Beatrix to think it is her mother's decision, which affects the way Beatrix thinks of her mother for years to come. But no matter who made the final decision, Beatrix is out of the way of the wartime bombing while becoming an integral part of another family.

The American Gregorys, Mr. and Mrs. G as Beatrix calls them, and their sons William and Gerald, absorb Beatrix into their family as if she's always been with them and Beatrix will be racked with guilt when she thinks about how they feel as much her family as her mom and dad back in London. In fact, as the years go by, her London life becomes a fuzzy memory. Still, she knows she'll have to go back to London, there is no way she can stay in the US and break the mother's heart.

The book is divided into three parts and Part 1 is my favorite part. Beatrix blossoms with the Gregorys, in a different way than she could have ever blossomed in war racked London. The family blossoms, too, and they never take for granted what having Beatrix in their life has given them. It's so interesting to me to know that children came to America to escape the war. I also know that many of them did not have the idyllic life that Beatrix has in this story.

Part 2 and 3 show us "life after Beatrix in America". Throughout the book we get short chapters (except for a few times when longer chapters are necessary) with viewpoints from the various characters. I feel like I really got to know each person and I miss this family now that the story is over. By family, I mean everyone, not just the Gregorys but Beatrix's mom and other characters that join the story as it progresses through the years. At the same time, there is such a melancholy feel to the story. In my opinion, one of the characters will never be happy, that is just the nature of that character. A few of the characters seem to settle for less than what they want for too long. But isn't that the way of real life?

But here I am, wishing the book wasn't so sad. And then we get towards the end and things seem too rosy. I think the sadness is probably more real than the rosy future outlook but I gravitate towards happy when I can so I'm thankful the story ends the way it ends. The people and the locations seem so real to me that it seems like I was there. It's going to take a while for me to get these characters out of my head. And I have Mrs. G's blueberry muffin recipe card and the brown paper and string parcel wrapping that my book came in to remind me of the hominess of this special story.
